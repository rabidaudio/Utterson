Swank - A Stupid-simple static webserver
========================================

Today doing some web development I got tired of messing with httpd.conf files with [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) every time I changed projects, so I whipped up a little project called [swank](https://github.com/rabidaudio/swank). Simply run swank from a terminal, optionally giving it the root path (if not the current working directory) and the port (if not 8000). It will spin up a static file webserver on your local machine, and spit back a link you can try in your browser. `Ctrl-C` to kill when you are done.

Sure, most browsers will open raw local files, but you run into issues with cross-site requests and over permissions. And the closer you can imitate a real webserver in development, the better. To install:

    [sudo] npm install -g swank

It is my first item on [npm](http://npmjs.org/). I was quite impressed with how easy it was to create a module and publish it. It is really nothing more than npm init (which is required for things like Heroku and good practice anyway) and `npm publish`.

I'd like to eventually drop the [Connect middleware](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) requirement, but it works for now (and it is realistically [about 15 lines of code](https://github.com/rabidaudio/swank/blob/master/swank.js). Here is the project on npm. Let me know what you think!

**EDIT:** The latest version of swank now has optional [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) support. Just add the `--ngrok` flag to the command, and have your server tunneled to the outside world. Pretty cool!
